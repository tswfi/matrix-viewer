# matrix-viewer

WIP! (and my first vue project)

We have a nice "info display" at [Tampere Hacklab](https://tampere.hacklab.fi/) and wanted to get matrix channel feed visible on it. So matrix-viewer was born.

Clone, Start up with ```yarn serve```, browse to config and insert your userid and token and go back to "home" page.

By default the view will contain all events. You can filter to a room by appending room id to the url (for example http://localhost/!jyWBEJPyRHmMunoagX:irc.snt.utwente.nl)
